## Project 1: The Infinite 'Unsquare' Well 

Developed a Python-based computational framework to solve the one-dimensional time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation (TISE) for an electron confined in an infinite "unsquare" potential well. Validated numerical results against analytical solutions and extended the analysis to harmonic/finite square wells to explore quantum confinement, tunneling, and eigenvalue behavior.
