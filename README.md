# Coding Projects

## Project 1: The Infinite 'Unsquare' Well 

Developed a Python-based computational framework to solve the one-dimensional time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation (TISE) for an electron confined in an infinite "unsquare" potential well. Validated numerical results against analytical solutions and extended the analysis to harmonic/finite square wells to explore quantum confinement, tunneling, and eigenvalue behavior.

## Project 2: Simulating Planetary Orbits

This Python project simulates planetary orbits using Newtonian physics and numerical methods. It models gravitational interactions between celestial bodies, featuring both single and two-body systems. The simulation implements Newton's Law of Gravitation with Euler's method for numerical integration. Built with NumPy and Matplotlib, it offers interactive visualizations of orbital dynamics through adjustable parameters. The project serves as both a physics demonstration and computational example, providing insights into orbital mechanics while demonstrating scientific programming techniques.
